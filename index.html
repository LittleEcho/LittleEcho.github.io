    I'm a graphic designer and Illustrator currently getting my degree in design from Western Washington Universty. I specialize in digital illustration and also enjoy branding and enjoy bringing that illustrative, playful look to all my graphic design!
    Along with design I also enjoy playing piano, musical theatre, hyperfixating on my favorite tv shows and drawing! Here you can browse both my design work as well as my illustration. Thanks for stopping by!
